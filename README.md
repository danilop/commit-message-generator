# 🤖 AI-Powered Git Commit Message Generator

Elevate your Git workflow with intelligent, context-aware commit messages generated by an AI language model.

## 🌟 Features

- **AI-Powered**: Leverages AI models via Amazon Bedrock for high-quality commit message generation.
- **Context-Aware**: Analyzes file changes, diffs, and commit history for comprehensive understanding.
- **Smart Formatting**: Generates commit messages following best practices, including summary lines and detailed explanations.
- **Interactive**: Allows user review and approval of generated commit messages.
- **Git-Integrated**: Seamlessly works with your existing Git workflow.
- **Customizable**: Supports debug mode for detailed logging and troubleshooting.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/commit-message-generator.git
   cd commit-message-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up AWS credentials:**
   Ensure your AWS credentials are configured with access to Amazon Bedrock.

4. **Add the script to your PATH:**
   ```
   export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/commit-message-generator"
   ```

5. **Run the script from within your repository:**
   ```
   commit-message-generator
   ```

5. **Review and approve** the generated commit message.

## 🛠️ Usage

After staging your changes in Git, run the script:

```
python commit-message-generator.py [--debug]

The script will:
1. Analyze staged changes
2. Generate a commit message using an AI model
3. Display the message for your review
4. Commit the changes if you approve

Use the `--debug` flag for detailed logging.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **File Analysis**: Gathers information about staged files, including content, history, and diffs.
2. **Prompt Generation**: Creates a detailed XML-formatted prompt, including file changes and commit context.
3. **AI Processing**: Sends the prompt to Amazon Bedrock for intelligent analysis.
4. **Message Generation**: The model generates a contextually relevant and well-formatted commit message.
5. **User Interaction**: Presents the generated message for user review and approval.
6. **Git Integration**: Commits the changes using the approved message.

## 🔧 Configuration

The script uses the following configuration:

- **AWS Region**: Set to `us-east-1` by default. Modify the `AWS_REGION` variable in the script if needed.
- **Anthropic's Claude Model**: Uses Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (`anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`). Update the `MODEL_ID` to use a different model/version.

## 🚨 Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling:

- Checks if the current directory is a Git repository
- Validates the presence of staged changes
- Handles file reading errors gracefully
- Manages API call failures

If you encounter issues, run the script with the `--debug` flag for more detailed logging.
